# RiverScriptBot

RiverScriptBot is an Angular-based UI project that implements a chatbot using a RiveScript-driven backend server, a scripting language for chatbots. The chatbot is inspired by the interactions between humans and computers, and it utilizes the power of RiveScript and JavaScript to create dynamic and engaging conversations.

## Demo

You can experience the RiverScriptBot in action by visiting the [RiverScriptBot Demo](https://liukonen.github.io/RiverScriptBot/).

## Background

During my college days, I became fascinated by the way humans interact with computers and vice versa. At the time, the options were limited, but I embarked on a project to integrate an AOL Instant Messenger source code with Sarra, an MS agent, to create an interactive chatbot. However, as time passed, the AIM client became outdated and I discovered AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) and the Alice project. I decided to reimplement my old chatbot using AIML, while also incorporating real-time data retrieval capabilities.

In 2016/2017, I was asked to present at the MMAC Be The Spark tour. For this event, I combined Sarra, Alice (with updated scripts), and Microsoft Cognitive Services to create a vocal chatbot capable of detecting and translating speech on the fly. The following year, I further enhanced the UI by enabling it to run on a webpage, automatically translating text for the user. The new version could detect, call, and translate from the user's native language to English and vice versa.

With this unused codebase and some time off work, I decided to release it to the world. I migrated my AIML code to RiverScript and leveraged the JavaScript implementation of [RiveScript](https://www.rivescript.com/) to power the chatbot. Translation capabilities will be implemented in a future release.
